# assignment4-template

**Learning Goals and Expectations**

- Develop the ability to implement the AVL tree rotation operations 

- Gain proficiency in implementing core heap operations and use them to sort an array exclusively through heap-based logic  

- Learn to trace and report the internal state of an AVL tree (including left, right, and height properties) during rotation procedures. 

**Instructions**

- Create your own repository from the assignment4-template repo. Name your repository as “assignment4-your-iu-username”. Make sure the repository is “Private”.   

- Once your own repository is created from the template, clone your repository and use the provided starter code for each problem to implement the requirements outlined below. 

- After implementing your coding solutions push your changes to the newly created repository and submit the commit URL to the corresponding assignment page on Canvas. Do not forget to submit the PDF file on Canvas for Part 3.
