FloodIt! Student Support Code
1. The function that roughly fits the graph is likely exponential, possibly quadratic, given the nested loops and iterations in the code.

2. The time complexity of the flood is O(n^2), where n is the board size. This is due to the nested loops iterating over the flooded_list and its neighbors.

3. Yes, the analysis matches up with the graph. The nested loops and iterations in the code contribute to a quadratic time complexity, which is reflected in the O(n^2) notation.

4. The flood  function uses ArrayLists, LinkedList, HashSet, and Sets for handling the flooded tiles and their neighbors. While the time isn't the best it does complete the task. While the other implementation uses Queue and HashSet for a simpler approach.

5. The time complexity of flood1 is O(n) where is checks all its visited spaces next to its neighbors. The HashSet "visited" ensures its only counted once so it doesnt have to count it again.
