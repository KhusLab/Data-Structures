This project implements a wire routing algorithm using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to connect endpoint pairs on a grid-based board while avoiding obstacles and existing wires. The algorithm simulates wire placement to avoid conflicts and retries wire routing in different orders if necessary.
Each wire is routed independently using BFS to find the shortest available path. If a wire cannot be placed due to conflicts, the algorithm reorders the goals and retries, keeping track of the best configuration. Once the best set of "route-able" wires is found, they are committed to the board.
The algorithm runs in O(n²) per path (where n is board size)
